# Python Guide for Bunya

## Introduction
This guide will help you make the most of the Bunya HPC cluster for your Python-based research.
It provides information for researchers who want to combine Python's extensive ecosystem with Bunya's powerful computing resources.
Resources provided by Bunya include:

- High-end accelerators (GPUs) for fast computation;
- High CPU capacity for parallel processing;
- Large memory capacity for data-intensive tasks; and
- High performance storage system to handle huge datasets.

While many of the concepts discussed here are also covered in RCC's general HPC documentation,
this guide focuses specifically on how they relate to running Python,
offering practical tips and examples to enhance your research experience.
The concepts are covered in the following sections:
1. [Compute Nodes](#compute-nodes)
2. [Modules](#modules)
3. [Storage](#storage)
4. [Python Environments](#python-environments)
5. [Batch vs Interactive Jobs](#batch-vs-interactive-jobs)
6. [User Interface](#user-interface)
   1. [The Jupyter Interface](#the-jupyter-interface)
   2. [Command Line Interface](#command-line-interface)

> [!Note]
> It is assumed you are familiar with managing Python environments on personal workstations or laptops but are unfamiliar with Bunya or HPC systems.

## User Interface
The **command line interface** and the **Jupyter** environment are two primary methods of interacting with Bunya to create, run and debug Python programs.
Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes a mix of using both is the most productive way of using Bunya for Python.

### The Jupyter Interface
Jupyter Labs or Notebook is a simple interactive interface available via Bunya's [On Demand](OnDemand-Guide.md) portal. It is similar to a Jupyter environment running a personal workstation or laptop but requires some extra steps that are covered later in this guide.

More Jupyter stuff here.

### Command Line Interface
The command line interface is the traditional way of interacting with HPC systems.
This is done with a terminal emulator running on your local machine.
Putty (Windows), Terminal (Mac), or VS Code.
